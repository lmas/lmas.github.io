This directory contains a list of **drafts** for the blog, in various stages of incompleteness.
They are **not final** and will be subjected to changes!

## Ideas for future posts

This is a list of interesting things and links to third party sources. The intent is *not to steal content whatsoever*.

and one day I would like expand on them.
